# fraud-detection
The repository contains code to analyze credit card transactions and predict whether transactions are fraudulent using machine learning algorithms. Machine learning workflow has been followed to train and fine-tune classification models. The steps are data collection and exploration, data processing, feature correlations, automating processing by pipelines, building models, evaluating performance by cross-validation, and fine-tuning the best-performing model based on precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
